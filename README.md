## How to start ðŸš€

### Requirements:
- Docker & Docker Compose install
- A `.env` file configured using the documentation within the `.env.example`

When everything is ready, run the following command

docker compose up --build
```

This will start 4 services:

- `frontend`: Serves the website of the Area prject (SvelteKit)

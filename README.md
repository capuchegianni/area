## How to start ðŸš€

### Requirements:
- Docker & Docker Compose install
- A `.env` file configured using the documentation within the `.env.example`

When everything is ready, run the following command
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start 4 services:
- `postgres`: The database that stores all informations needed for the app to work
- `redis`: Used to cache request to the REST API
- `backend`: Brain of the REST API (Nest.js)
- `frontend`: Serves the website of the Area prject (SvelteKit)

## How to install packages ðŸ“¦

Since the project is using NPM workspaces, all package installations should be done at the root of the project.

To first install all the packages, run the following command (at the root of the project):
```bash
npm install
```

To add a new package to the project, run the following command (always at the root of the project):
```bash
npm install <package-name> -w <workspace-name>
```
Where `<package-name>` is the name of the package you want to install and `<workspace-name>` is the name of the workspace you want to install the package in.\
For example, to install the `typescript` package in the `backend` workspace (which is in `apps/backend/`), you would run:
```bash
npm install -D typescript -w apps/backend
```

âš  Never install a package directly in a workspace folder, always use the root of the project to install packages.

If you need to install a package using a CLI, you can anyway do it in the workspace folder. After the installation is done, delete the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file in the workspace folder and re-run `npm install` at the root of the project.\
For example, to install a shadcn component in the frontend, you would run:
```bash
cd apps/frontend
npx shadcn-svelte@latest add <component>
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
cd ../..
npm install
```

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This application uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Add a UI component

To add a UI component to the application, you can use the components provided by `react-native-reusables`.

1. Go to [React Native Reusable docs](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app).
2. Find a component you want to use.
3. Follow the installation instructions (use CLI installation).
4. Use the component in the application.

### Add an icon

`lucide-react-native` provides a set of icons that you can use in the application.\
In order to be able to use them, you need to follow the steps described in the [React Native Reusable/Adding Icons documentation](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/getting-started/adding-icons).

## Testing

You can follow the [Expo/Unit testing documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing/#unit-test) to learn how to add tests to the application.
